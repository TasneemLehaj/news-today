                                    let and const? </h5>
                                <p class="card-text"> In JavaScript, users can declare a variable using 3 keywords that
                                    are var, let, and const.<br>
                                    <b>var : </b> The var is the oldest keyword to declare a variable in JavaScript.var
                                    declarations are globally scoped or function/locally scoped.

                                    The scope is global when a var variable is declared outside a function. This means
                                    that any variable that is declared with var outside a function block is available
                                    for use in the whole window.

                                    var is function scoped when it is declared within a function. This means that it is
                                    available and can be accessed only within that function.
                                    <b> let :</b> Let declares variable that are limited to the scope of a block
                                    statement. Let can be updated but not re-declared.
                                    Just like var, a variable declared with let can be updated within its scope. Unlike
                                    var, a let variable cannot be re-declared within its scope. It is an ES6
                                    feature.<br>
                                    <b> const: </b> const declarations are block scoped
                                    Like let declarations, and they can only be accessed within the block they
                                    were declared. Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. Const
                                    declarations share some similarities with let declarations.But const cannot be
                                    updated
                                    or re-declared.
                                    This means that the value of a variable declared with const remains the same within
                                    its scope.Every const declaration, therefore,
                                    must be initialized at the time of declaration.
                                </p>
                                <p>Another thing to mention is that, they are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But
                                    while var variables are initialized with undefined, let and const variables are not
                                    initialized.</p>

                                    function and an arrow function? </h5>
                                <p class="card-text"> Regular functions created using function declarations or
                                    expressions are constructible and callable. Since regular functions are
                                    constructible, they can be called using the new keyword. However, the arrow
                                    functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be
                                    used as constructor functions.Also inside the body of a regular function, arguments
                                    is a
                                    special array-like object containing the list of arguments with which the function
                                    has been invoked.On the other side, no arguments special keyword is defined inside
                                    an arrow function.Again,if the return statement is missing, or there's no expression
                                    after
                                    return statement, a regular function implicitely returns undefined where the arrow
                                    function returns value as the same way as from a regular function, but with one
                                    useful exception.
                                    If the arrow function contains one expression, and if the function's curly braces
                                    are omitted, then the expression is implicitly returned. These are the inline arrows
                                    function.</p>

                                    string in JavaScript? </h5>
                                <p class="card-text"> Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript
                                    released in ES6. It lets us insert/interpolate variables and expressions into
                                    strings without needing to concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript. It
                                    allows us to create strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements.In
                                    addition to its syntactical differences there are two very specific advantages to
                                    using template literals: Multi-line strings: A single string can span two or more
                                    lines. Expression Interpolation: Javascript variables and expressions can be
                                    inserted directly in the string.</p>
